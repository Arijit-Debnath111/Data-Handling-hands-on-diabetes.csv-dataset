# Data-Handling-hands-on-diabetes.csv-dataset
It is basically experiment on Diabetes dataset.
THe Agenda is Implememtation of Model Hyperparameter Tuning.
# Model Creation---> RandomForest Classifer.
# Checking the Acuracy
# Following Industry Approach ---> Tuning process.
# GridSearch CV
# RandomSearch CV



# Criterion=the Function used to evaluate the quality of split
#Max_depth=maximun depth or number of levels of individual decision tree.
#max_features: maximun number of features considered when spliting node.
#n_estimators: number of trees in random forest.
# min_samples_leaf: minimun number of samples which can be stored in tree leaf.
# min_samples_split: minimun number of samples necessary in a node to have the spliting of node.


# RandomSearch CV: optimized sample space---> nearby values of hyperparameter

# # Gridsearch CV: best values for my hyperparameter.
# For example:  Air Raid by Nation x for identifying hostage camps.
